# master (unreleased)
- Introduce `.foster_select` a helper for select statements that can handel aliasing and provides casting options for many common aggregate functions.
Supports any aggregate that does not require multiple arguments (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `ARRAY_AGG`, etc..): [Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
  - Supports Aggregate `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` inner expressions.
- Reduced the code foot-print for declaring new Arel functions
- Introduce new `Arel::Nodes::AggregateFunctionName` for dealing with inline-ing `ORDER BY` (will be expanded to handel `FILTER` next)
- Introduce `cast_with:` for `.select_row_to_json`. 
  - Supported options: `true (array)`, `:array`, `array_agg`, `array_agg_distinct`
  
### 2.0 Deprecation Warning
- In order to keep options standardized, `.select_row_to_json` will be dropping `cast_to_array` in favor of the `cast_with` option.

# 0.5.0 - May 31st 2018

Released non-marked beta version.

# 0.5.0.beta3 - May 28th 2018

Added `inet_contains_or_contained_within/1` method

# 0.5.0.beta2 - May 27th 2018

Renamed inet functions to hopefully give a clearer understanding to what these methods are used for.

Added support for Postgres Inet functions. View the readme for more details on the following:

- `#inet_contained_within/1`
- `#inet_contained_within_or_equals/1`
- `#inet_contains_or_equals/1`
- `#inet_contains/1`

### Deprecation Warnings
The following will be dropped upon v1.0 release. In favor of their prefixed counterparts.

- `#contained_within/1`

- `#contains_or_equals/1`

# 0.5.0.beta1 - May 26th 2018

Added support for Rails 5.0.x

### Warning for Rails 5.0.x Projects
The proposed changes to this could cause unintended behavior in existing Rails 5.0.x applications. 
This is due to the overwrite needed to be done on its internal Predicate builder. 
Rails projects above 5.0.x should not experience any unforeseen issues since they contain the necessary structure required.

**Use with caution.** And always make sure you have good tests to verify everything in your application.
