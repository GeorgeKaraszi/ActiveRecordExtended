# 3.0.0 - August 14th 2022

## Major Changes:

- Implementation of ActiveSupport autoloader
  - Query methods and patches will now only be loaded once ActiveRecord has been fully loaded. 
  - This should aid people that are having a hard time getting some query methods such as the `union` to load and work properly.

#### Breaking Changes:

- Dropped Rails 5.1 support.
- Dropped Ruby 2.4 support.
- Dropped Postgres 9.6 support.
- Arel for ActiveRecord 6.1+ `contains` will no longer accept INET (ip address column types), use `inet_contains` instead.
  - ActiveRecord `contains` should remain unaffected as it never accepted INET column types.

# 2.0.0 - December 22nd 2020

## Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/GeorgeKaraszi/ActiveRecordExtended/pull/47) Added Rails 6.1 support (gigorok)

### Breaking Changes
- Rails 5.0.x Has been fully deprecated.
- Ruby 2.3.x Has been fully deprecated.
- JSON methods option: `cast_as_array` has been officially deprecated. Please use `cast_with: :array` instead.
- Redesigned CTE's structure. CTE tables are now held in their relations WithCTE class.
- Redesigned CTE structure method `.with` & `.with!` only accepts `Hash/Keyword` and `WithCTE` instance arguments.
    -  Dev Note: In an effort to trying to maintain as many ways of accepting CTE's in various forms
       (Array's, Strings, Hashes, etc..) was becoming overwhelming to maintain and wasn't realistic to continue this path.
       And since you can't have duplicate CTE's with the same name, a Hash makes perfect sense.
       
#### Bug fixes:
 - Fixed `.with` CTE recursive flag not transferring when merging subqueries.
 - Fixed (Rails 6.x) `.with` Subqueries that contain CTE's of their own, are now piped to the parent like other methods.
 - Fixed (Rails 6.x) No partition by arguments for window functions are provided.
 - Fixed Rails 6.1 `Arel::Node` missing error.
 - Fixed duplicate where constraints when using `where.any_of` / `where.none_of`
 - Fixed Ruby 2.7 warning: `Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated`

# 1.4.0 - November 6th 2019

Performance tweaks:
 - [#33](https://github.com/GeorgeKaraszi/ActiveRecordExtended/pull/33) Reduce object creations when using the ruby shorthand `&method()`.

# 1.3.1 - October 2nd 2019

Bug fix:
 - Prevent STI models from appending where clauses to `select_row_to_json(b)` method scopes

# 1.3.0 - September 9th 2019

- Add [Postgres Window Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html) to ActiveRecord querying level.
  - introduces two new methods that are used in conjunction: `.define_window` & `.select_window`
### `define_window/1` && `partition_by/2`
 Defines one or many windows that will be place at the bottom of your query. 
 This will also require you to define a partition via `.parition_by(:column)/2`.
 
 - `partition_by/2` arguments:
    - column name being partitioned
    - `order_by` Processes how the window should be orders
    
Example:
 
 - `User.define_window(:w).partition_by(:name, order_by: :join_date)`
 
###  `select_window/4`

Arguments:

- [Window Function Name](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html)
- Function's arguments \*optional\* 
- `over:`
    - The window name given when constructing `.define_window`
- `as:` \*optional\*
    - Alias name to give the final result
    
Overall Examples: 
   - `User.define_window(:w).partition_by(:name).select_window(:row_number, over: :w, as: :r_id)`
   - `User.define_window(:w).partition_by(:name).select_window(:first_value, :id,  over: :w, as: :first_id)`

# 1.2.0 - August 11th 2019

## Changes
- Introduce `.foster_select` a helper for select statements that can handle aliasing and provides casting options for many common aggregate functions.
Supports any aggregate that does not require multiple arguments (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `ARRAY_AGG`, etc..): [Aggregate Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
  - Supports Aggregate `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` inner expressions.
- Reduced the code foot-print for declaring new Arel functions
- Introduce new `Arel::Nodes::AggregateFunctionName` for dealing with inline-ing `ORDER BY` (will be expanded to handle `FILTER` next)
- Code cleanup and some minor performance tweaks

##### Changes to `.select_row_to_json`
- Argument-less scoped blocks (inner-block argument is now optional)
- `cast_with:` 
  - Supported options: `true` (array), `:array`, `:array_agg`, `distinct`, and `:to_jsonb`
- `order_by:` : Accepts ActiveRecord like options for ordering responses from an array or aggregated array

### Bugfixes
- [#26](https://github.com/GeorgeKaraszi/ActiveRecordExtended/pull/26) Support for class namespace for `inet_contains` [@znakaska](https://github.com/znakaska)
- [#27](https://github.com/GeorgeKaraszi/ActiveRecordExtended/pull/27) Fixed `TO_JSONB` class name typo that would cause an exception
  
### 2.0 Deprecation Warning
- In order to keep options standardized, `.select_row_to_json` will be dropping `cast_to_array` in favor of the `cast_with` option;
  Furthermore, the default `true` for `cast_with` option will be deprecated as well in favor of more verbose `:array` option

Add support for Postgres Common Table Expression (CTE) methods.

- `.with/1`
- `.with.recursive/1`

# 0.6.0 - July 25th 2018

Reduced Gem file allocation. We only care about stuff in the lib directory.

# 0.5.1 - June 3rd 2018

Relaxed PG gem requirement for allowing version 1 to be used.

# 0.5.0 - May 31st 2018

Released non-marked beta version.

# 0.5.0.beta3 - May 28th 2018

Added `inet_contains_or_contained_within/1` method

# 0.5.0.beta2 - May 27th 2018

Renamed inet functions to hopefully give a clearer understanding to what these methods are used for.

Added support for Postgres Inet functions. View the readme for more details on the following:

- `#inet_contained_within/1`
- `#inet_contained_within_or_equals/1`
- `#inet_contains_or_equals/1`
- `#inet_contains/1`

### Deprecation Warnings
The following will be dropped upon v1.0 release. In favor of their prefixed counterparts.

- `#contained_within/1`
- `#contained_within_or_equals/1`
- `#contains_or_equals/1`

# 0.5.0.beta1 - May 26th 2018

Added support for Rails 5.0.x

### Warning for Rails 5.0.x Projects
The proposed changes to this could cause unintended behavior in existing Rails 5.0.x applications. 
This is due to the overwrite needed to be done on its internal Predicate builder. 
Rails projects above 5.0.x should not experience any unforeseen issues since they contain the necessary structure required.

**Use with caution.** And always make sure you have good tests to verify everything in your application.

# 0.4.0 - May 9th 2018
